            <h2 style="text-align: center">Holmes Investment Properties PLC in advanced talks with Peak Resorts</h2>
            <h3>24 May 2017</h3>
            <p>
                Holmes Investment Properties PLC is pleased to announce that advanced talks are progressing with Peak Resorts, a £400 million leisure development in Derbyshire, England, to site one of our first adventure parks.
                <br><br>
                Peak Resorts, located on the edge of the Peak District National Park was first publicised by Mr David Cameron when he was Prime Minister of the UK. The project brings together leading hospitality, university, sports and medical expertise and includes 600 holiday apartments, 250 woodland lodges and a hotel.
                <br><br>
                Each adventure park, the concept developed by Mr David Lloyd, will have plenty of space for internal and external activities from trampolines, soft play for under 5s, track gliders, zip wires and fun outdoors activities like crazy golf as well as bringing exciting new activities to the market.  In addition, the new adventure parks will typically include landscaped picnic areas with BBQ pits for a great summer outdoors experience.
                <br><br>
                Holmes Investment Properties CEO, Martin Helme said: “We are pleased to have engaged with Peak Resorts at an early stage so that we can hopefully incorporate one of our first UK adventure parks. Planning permission for the whole project has already been granted and final negotiations are progressing. We will provide further updates shortly.”

            <h2 style="text-align: center">Holmes Investment Properties PLC Signs MoU with Major Trampoline Operator</h2>
            <h3>20 May 2017</h3>
            <p>
                Holmes Investment Properties Plc (HIP) have secured a second sports and leisure partner, for whom HIP will source and purchase land to develop sports and leisure centres on their behalf.
                <br><br>
                HIP is a land investment company which currently operates specifically in the sports, leisure and entertainment market to benefit from the sector’s continued strong growth. According to research there are 6,435 leisure centres in the UK (source: leisuredb), with an additional 150 venues opening each year, leaving plenty of scope to grow for HIP and its partners.
                <br><br>
                The new partners are an established trampoline operator with significant growth plans over the coming years.  The Memorandum of Understanding is a non-exclusive arrangement to find land in parts of the UK that the operator does not currently have venues.  HIP will deliver sites that will allow for a high quality, large venue with trampolines at the heart of the operation and ample car parking.  The operator will lease the chosen sites on a long term basis. Once planning permission is granted, Holmes Investment Properties will then fund and build each site to shell and core before passing over to our partner to fit out and open.
                <br><br>
                Martin Helme, CEO of Holmes Investment Properties added: “We are constantly searching for land to buy then build sports and leisure centres. Our new partner has agreed a Memorandum of Understanding which will allow us to source land for them on a non-exclusive basis. This second partner in the sports and leisure sector will increase the opportunity for HIP to lease out more venues in this growing market. That’s very good news.”

                Over his long career, Mr Lloyd has founded two multi-million pound businesses: David Lloyd Leisure and – with his son Scott - Next Generation Clubs.
                <br><br>
                Mr. Lloyd has recently spotted a gap in the market for one-stop, multi-exercise parks that will offer both brilliant indoor and outdoor activities. His new enterprise will take advantage of fast growing segments in the £4 billion UK leisure sector, bringing together hard-to-find but easy-to-enjoy activities such as trampolining, zip wires, soft play and climbing walls. The plan is for the first adventure parks to open in 2018, with all twelve open by 2021.
                <br><br>
                Holmes Investment Properties has an exclusive contract to fund and build the first twelve sports activity centres for Mr Lloyd’s Company. Holmes Investment Properties will own the land and fund the purchase and construction of the parks. After the construction, Mr Lloyd's company will fit out and operate the properties.

            <h2 style="text-align: center">Holmes Investment Properties PLC update on sites for new UK Adventure Parks</h2>
            <h3>8 May 2017</h3>
            <p>
                Holmes Investment Properties PLC are pleased to announce that our partners, DLAPL, are making satisfactory progress in finding sites to locate the first UK adventure parks for Mr David Lloyd. To date, Mr Lloyd has identified five sites that he currently intends to put an option to purchase on, subject to planning permission being granted, and funding approval.
                <br><br>
                Holmes Investment Properties PLC can confirm that we have a £42 million loan facility from a major finance house available. Funds will be released based on the commercial viability of each site.
                <br><br>
                Once planning permission is granted, Holmes Investment Properties will fund and develop sites before passing them over to Mr Lloyd’s company to fit out and open. At the opening of each venue, the directors expect that the land value will be significantly enhanced as a commercially viable operation will now be sited there. Buying and developing each site will typically cost Holmes Investment Properties between £3 and £5 million. Mr Lloyd’s company will take a minimum 25-year lease on each site, with a rental yield of 8% of the value of the site.
                <br><br>
                Each site will have space for internal and external activities from trampolines, soft play for under 5’s, dodge ball, zip wires and fun outdoors activities such as crazy golf as well as exciting new activities brought to the market. In addition, the new adventure parks will typically include outdoor picnic areas with BBQ pits and other adventures.
                <br><br>
                Holmes Investment Properties, CEO, Martin Helme said: “The identification of the first 5 sites is an exciting development. Whilst there is clearly a long way to go, we are on target to open the first adventure park in 2018.”

                The Company has also announced that Mr Martin Helme and Mr Nicolas Holmes, both directors of Holmes Investment Properties, have consented to act as directors of Cariboo Gold Mines Plc, which has confirmed such appointments as required with the Registrar of Companies as in accordance with the terms of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (“SBEEA”). Their appointment will strengthen the management team as the company embarks on its next chapter.
                <br><br>
                The transaction speeds up the business proposition of Holmes Investment Properties, which acts as the property company to the entrepreneur Mr David Lloyd for his new enterprise. Mr Lloyd’s latest venture will benefit because Holmes Investment Properties will now have new access to capital markets resulting from the takeover by Cariboo Gold Mines Plc, which also provides investors with an opportunity to participate.
                <br><br>
                Holmes Investment Properties has an exclusive contract to fund and build the first twelve sports activity centres for Mr Lloyd’s Company. Over his long career, Mr Lloyd has founded two multi-million pound businesses: David Lloyd Leisure and – with his son Scott - Next Generation Clubs; and has recently spotted a new gap in the market for one-stop, multi-exercise parks that will offer both brilliant indoor and outdoor activities. The plan is for the first parks to open in 2018, with all twelve open by 2021. Holmes Investment Properties will own the land and fund the purchase and construction of the parks. After the construction, Mr Lloyd's company will fit out and operate the properties.
                <br><br>
                Martin Helme, CEO of Cariboo Gold Mines Plc said: "We believe that Mr. David Lloyd is the most successful sports venue entrepreneur in Europe, and he is now concentrating on building a unique, exciting business that people will flock to.  Holmes Investment Properties, our property division, are experts in funding and development, so it makes sense for Mr Lloyd to leave this part of the process to us.”
                <br><br>
                Mr David Lloyd, Executive Chairman and majority shareholder in the adventure park concept said: “I’m thrilled to have the chance to use my experience in the leisure industry and transfer it to this new sector. I’m convinced that our adventure parks will be a great success and Holmes Investment Properties have proven to be the perfect partners.”

                “I built some of the first commercial leisure centres in the UK and they were also some of the largest, most profitable. As the market evolves, we are bringing together rare-to-find, but easy-to-love new activities from climbing walls to zip wires and the biggest collection of trampolines in one place. I’ve got thirty-four years’ experience in the sector, and we will be using everything that we have learnt to make our new adventure parks the best leisure centres in the country.”
