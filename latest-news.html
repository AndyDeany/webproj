            <p>
                The Company has also announced that Mr Martin Helme and Mr Nicolas Holmes, both directors of Holmes Investment Properties, have consented to act as directors of Cariboo Gold Mines Plc, which has confirmed such appointments as required with the Registrar of Companies as in accordance with the terms of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (“SBEEA”). Their appointment will strengthen the management team as the company embarks on its next chapter.
                <br><br>
                The transaction speeds up the business proposition of Holmes Investment Properties, which acts as the property company to the entrepreneur Mr David Lloyd for his new enterprise, “David Lloyd’s Adventure Parks.” Mr. Lloyd’s latest venture will benefit because Holmes Investment Properties will now have new access to capital markets resulting from the takeover by Cariboo Gold Mines Plc, which also provides investors with an opportunity to participate.
                <br><br>
                Holmes Investment Properties has an exclusive contract to fund and build the first twelve sports activity centres for Mr Lloyd’s Company, “David Lloyd’s Adventure Parks.” Over his long career, Mr Lloyd has founded two multi-million pound businesses: David Lloyd Leisure and – with his son Scott - Next Generation Clubs; and has recently spotted a new gap in the market for one-stop, multi-exercise parks that will offer both brilliant indoor and outdoor activities. The plan is for the first parks to open in 2018, with all twelve open by 2021. Holmes Investment Properties will own the land and fund the purchase and construction of the parks. After the construction, “David Lloyd's Adventure Parks” will fit out and operate the properties.
                <br><br>
                Martin Helme, CEO of Cariboo Gold Mines Plc said: "We believe that Mr. David Lloyd is the most successful sports venue entrepreneur in Europe, and he is now concentrating on building a unique, exciting business that people will flock to.  Holmes Investment Properties, our property division, are experts in funding and development, so it makes sense for Mr Lloyd to leave this part of the process to us.”
                <br><br>
                Mr David Lloyd, Executive Chairman and majority shareholder in “David Lloyd’s Adventure Parks” said: “I’m thrilled to have the chance to use my experience in the leisure industry and transfer it to this new sector. I’m convinced that our adventure parks will be a great success and Holmes Investment Properties have proven to be the perfect partners.”

                “I built some of the first commercial leisure centres in the UK and they were also some of the largest, most profitable. As the market evolves, we are bringing together rare-to-find, but easy-to-love new activities from climbing walls to zip wires and the biggest collection of trampolines in one place. I’ve got thirty-four years’ experience in the sector, and we will be using everything that we have learnt to make our new adventure parks the best leisure centres in the country.”
