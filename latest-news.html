                Holmes Investment Properties has signed a long-term contract to fund the
                next generation of leisure centres in the UK for the successful leisure
                entrepreneur, David Lloyd.
            </p>


            <h2>David Lloyd</h2>
            <h3>Non-Executive Chairman and majority shareholder in David Lloyd’s Adventure Parks<br>added:</h3>
            <p>
                “I built some of the first commercial leisure centres in the UK and they were also some of
                the largest, most profitable and most. As the market evolves, we are bringing together rare
                to find, but easy to love new activities from climbing walls to zip wires and the biggest
                collection of trampolines in one place. I’ve got thirty-four years’ experience in the sector,
                and we will be using everything that we have learnt to make our new adventure parks the
                best leisure centres in the country.”
            </p>


            <h2>Martin Helme</h2>
            <h3>Chief Executive Officer<br>said:</h3>
            <p>
                "David Lloyd is the most successful leisure entrepreneur in Europe, and he wants to
                concentrate on building an exciting new business that people will flock to. The UK leisure
                market continues to expand by about 150 venues per annum and David Lloyd’s Adventure
                Parks will be part of this growth. Holmes Investment Properties are property experts and it
                makes sense to leave the funding and building to us. We are at the start of a fantastic adventure."
