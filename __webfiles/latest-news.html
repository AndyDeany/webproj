                <p>
                    Holmes Investment Properties has signed a 50-year contract to fund the next generation of leisure centres in the UK
                    for the successful leisure entrepreneur, David Lloyd. Signed on 1st October 2016, Mr Lloyd will search and find new
                    sites for brand new David Lloyd Adventure Parks. A Letter of Intent, subject to planning permission will be signed
                    between Holmes Investment Properties, David Lloyd Adventure Parks and the landowner to build a new leisure centre
                    on the land with associated facilities.
                    <br><br>
                    Once planning permission is agreed Holmes Investment Properties will fund the purchase of the land and build the
                    shell of the building. Once finished, Mr Lloyd and his company will fit out the new adventure parks.
                    <br><br>
                    Commenting on the contract Mr Lloyd said: I built some of the first commercial leisure centres in the UK and they
                    were also some of the largest, most profitable and with most members.  The market has changed today, and I plan to
                    offer a whole new group of activities to people. The offer will be led by a safe, exciting trampoline offer and also
                    include dodge ball, soft play for under 5s and fantastically exciting zip wires. I hope David Lloyd Adventure Parks
                    will be as synonymous with leisure activities as my previous companies.
                    <br><br>

                    <p>
                        "David Lloyd is the most successful leisure entrepreneur in Europe, and he wants to concentrate on building an
                        exciting business that people will flock to. Holmes Investment Properties are property experts and it makes sense
                        to leave the funding and building to us.  We are the start of a fantastic 50-year adventure."
