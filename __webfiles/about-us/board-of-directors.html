                <h3>David Lloyd</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Age 71, Independent Non-Executive Chairman</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Mr Lloyd was born on 3rd January 1948 in the Great Britain. Mr. Lloyd and his younger brother,
                    John Lloyd were two of the most successful British tennis players throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
                    <br><br>
                    Following retirement from professional tennis, Mr. Lloyd worked for a number of years as a coach
                    at a tennis club in Canada. Here he got the idea of creating his own tennis and health club in the
                    UK and on his return to Britain, he founded the David Lloyd Leisure Clubs, opening the first club
                    in Heston, near Hounslow in west London, in 1982. It was a pioneering concept in health and fitness:
                    family oriented clubs with an emphasis on tennis. The business was floated on the London Stock
                    Exchange in 1992 and by 1995, there were 18 David Lloyd Leisure clubs, when Whitbread Plc acquired
                    the company for a reported £200 million, a record in the City at that time, incorporating it into
                    its Restaurants & Leisure Division. Lloyd remained as managing director of the division until 1996.
                    <br><br>
                    Mr. Lloyd, together with his son Scott, went on to create Next Generation fitness clubs and in 2007,
                    London & Regional Properties in partnership with Bank of Scotland, acquired David Lloyd Leisure from
                    Whitbread and incorporated Next Generation into the group for £925M.
                    <br><br>
                    Mr Lloyd has specific experience in finding sites and in particular developing eighteen significant
                    leisure centres, some of the biggest leisure venues in the country. Mr Lloyd found sites, gained
                    planning permission and funding, and built each of his first eighteen David Lloyd Centres from scratch.
                    Mr Lloyd has thirty years’ experience in successful, large leisure-orientated building projects in
                    the UK and across the world, creating highly valuable top-quality venues.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2013 the David Lloyd group was purchased by TDR Capital for £750M and now includes 91 UK and European
                    David Lloyd Leisure Clubs including two exclusive Harbour Clubs and five David Lloyd Studios, with a
                    membership of around 440,000 and employing some 6,000 staff. (Company website). The average David Lloyd
                    leisure centre was valued at £8.2M, far higher than any competitor sites, which are valued on average
                    between £3-4M. (Source: Virgin Active Annual Accounts 2015/Bannatyne’s public statement 2015).
                    <br><br>
                    David Lloyd is arguably the most successful leisure operator in the UK.  David Lloyd Clubs are valued at
                    £8.2M per club (when purchased by TDR Capital) and had a higher profit than competitors (last public
                    figures available 2012). David Lloyd clubs also have more members per club, higher revenue per club and
                    it is believed higher profitability per club than all of its competitors.
                    <br><br>
                    Following the sale of the leisure business, Mr. Lloyd turned his attention to real estate and developed
                    the highly acclaimed Sugar Hill Resort in Barbados, where purchasers included superstars, Sir Cliff
                    Richard, John Lodge of the Moody Blues and famous entertainers.
                    <br><br>
                    He  later  founded  David Lloyd  Resorts, a holiday property shared-ownership concept. More recently,
                    David Lloyd Signature Homes, was established, a property sales business specializing in French Alpine ski
                    properties and also featuring high quality properties in St Tropez, Monaco, a wine estate near Cap d'Agde
                    in the Languedoc region, city centre apartments in Lisbon Portugal and a beach-front resort in Mauritius.
