                <h2>Corporate Governance</h2>
                <p>
                    The Directors are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and, as far as is considered
                    practicable and appropriate for a public company of Holmes Investment Propertiesâ€™ size, seek to apply the principles of good governance set
                    out in the UK Corporate Governance Code issued in September 2012. However, the Company does not fully comply with
                    the UK Corporate Governance Code but we have reported on our corporate governance arrangements by drawing upon best
                    practice available, including those aspects of the UK Corporate Governance Code we consider to be relevant to the Company,
                    even though it is not compulsory for AIM-listed companies.
