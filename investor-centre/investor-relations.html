                <h3>Forward-looking Statements</h3>
                <p>
                    This Document may contain forward-looking statements. These statements relate to the Company's future prospects,
                    developments and business strategies.
                    <br><br>
                    Forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as "believe", "could",
                    “anticipate”, "intend", "may", "plan", "will" or the negative of those, variations or comparable expressions,
                    including references to assumptions. These statements are primarily contained in Part I of this Document.
                    <br><br>
                    The forward-looking statements in this Document are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and
                    uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by those
                    statements. Certain risks to and uncertainties for the Company are specifically described in Part II of this
                    Document headed "Risk Factors". If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialises, or if underlying
                    assumptions prove incorrect, the Company's actual results may vary materially from those expected, estimated, or projected.
                    Given these risks and uncertainties, potential investors should not place any reliance on forward-looking statements.
                    <br><br>
                    These forward-looking statements speak only as at the date of this Document. Neither the Directors nor the Company
                    undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements or the Risk Factors described in this Document other
                    than as required by the NSX Market or by the rules of any other relevant securities regulatory authority, whether as a
                    result of new information, future events or otherwise.

                <h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2>
                <p>
                    When I retired from professional tennis many years ago, I saw an opening in the leisure market.
                    I felt I could give the same opportunity that I had to millions of people. Until then many perceived
                    that high quality tennis and leisure clubs were the preserve of a few. I believed I could open the
                    market to a much broader population.  So, I found locations and started to build David Lloyd sports
                    and racket clubs in towns and cities across the UK. The company that still bears my name today was
                    purchased for £925M in 2007 and again for £750 million in 2013 and has been followed by many competitors.
                    By 2015, 9.2 million people were members of leisure clubs in the UK, that’s 14.3% of the population,
                    a statistic I am very proud of.
                    <br><br>
                    The leisure market continues to diversify and new opportunities have come along in different sports.
                    I am now committed to making these available to a broader population. My new idea could therefore,
                    be an even more popular proposition than my successful forays in sports and leisure in the past.
                    <br><br>
                    My plan is to put fun, energetic, rare-to-find activities together, led by an incredible trampoline offer,
                    where over 100 trampolines are connected for guests to bounce and somersault around the whole venue.
                    There will be complementary sports, such as zip-wire adventures, climbing “cardio” walls, soft play
                    for the under 5s and internal crazy golf courses, which are great fun for everyone.
                    <br><br>
                    The benefits of these simple-to-learn sports are they can be enjoyed by individuals and families
                    and at all ages.  The other good news is that these activities can be delivered in small spaces,
                    which can be found in easy-to-get-to locations.
                    <br><br>
                    In leisure centres today, food is almost an after-thought, with regimented bland pizza and chips on offer,
                    not for enjoyment but for fast consumption which is quickly forgotten! Themed restaurants have proven
                    that food can be interesting, healthy and entertaining. Fun, fresh, quality food can be offered anywhere
                    with proper application, and that’s exactly what I aim to do in our new sports and leisure venues.
                    <br><br>
                    My new business proposition offers two bites of the monetary cherry: Delivering hard-to-find sporty
                    activities and fun, fresh food situated on relatively low cost, small scale sites in convenient locations
                    that will appeal to all ages, all individuals and all families. Add in my brand name; known and trusted
                    in this arena for more than 30 years, and I believe we will have a fast growing business very quickly.
                    In fact, I already have the first venue open, in the suburbs of London.  It was cash positive from day
                    one of launch, a gross profit was achieved in month one and my aim is that all investment will be paid
                    back by the end of year one. When I add my name to the concept, I hope it will grow its popularity further.
                    Our first adventure park, the MegaJump centre in London, overseen by my son,
                    Scott and I is already a post-revenue company.
                    <br><br>
                    As our first venue has made a net profit before tax, I want to offer the brand to the whole country,
                    and in the future, across Europe too. Therefore, I need to act fast to ensure market leadership.
                    The challenge for me, and why I have come to the market, is raising money to purchase a number of sites
                    and fitting out the new centres. Land costs in UK towns and cities are now significantly higher in relative
                    terms to when I started out in 1982. Therefore, the success of the venture is as dependent on property
                    skills as much as it is leisure operating skills. The property element is the catalyst for the operation.
                    That’s why I have teamed up with a group of senior property professionals to form Holmes Investment
                    Properties Plc (HIP Plc). HIP Plc will be led by the Holmes family. Like me, they have run eponymous
                    businesses for many decades. Mr Holmes senior started his surveying company back in the 1950s.
                    Then Robert Holmes, his son, began his highly successful property investment company in Wimbledon Village
                    in 1987. Robert’s sons, James and Nick Holmes, are involved in their father’s agency, their own property
                    dealings, and now HIP Plc.
                    <br><br>
                    This listing brings the property element to the market. Holmes Investment Properties will fund sites and
                    the development then charge a pre-agreed, long-term contractual rent of 8% per annum on each site to the
                    operating company, David Lloyd Adventure Parks (DLAP). Each site will have a 50-year minimum contract
                    between HIP and the DLAP operating company. We have faith in the sixty years of property experience that
                    the Holmes family have delivered. With a ready-made market, HIP Plc will have a head start working with
                    a post-revenue company with another well-known, successful family brand name. I will act as Executive
                    Chairman for DLAP and be connected with HIP as non-executive Chairman for the property company,
                    as well as 15% shareholder in HIP Plc. I hope you can support our new adventure;
                    I think it will be very exciting for all of us.

                    Each CDI entitles its holder to one underlying Share. All Shares represented by CO is offered under this
                    Information Memorandum will rank equally with the existing Shares already on issue in the Company,
                    and entitle the holder to one to vote per Share held.
                    <br><br>
                    The [   ] CO is and the underlying Shares will represent [  ] of the [  ] issued Shares in the Company

                <h3>What are COIs?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Company is incorporated in the United Kingdom, which does not recognize the CHESS which does not recognize
                    the CHESS system of holding securities or electronic transfer of legal title to shares. To enable companies to
                    have their securities cleared and settled electronically through CHESS, depository interests called CHESS
                    Depository Interests (COIs) are issued. COI Holders receive all of the economic benefits of actual ownership
                    of the underlying shares. COIs are traded in a manner similar to shares of Australian companies listed on the NSX.
                    <br><br>
                    CDIs will be held in uncertificated form and settled/transferred through CHESS. No share certificates will be issued
                    to CDI Holders.  Shareholders cannot trade their Shares on NSX without first converting their Shares into COIs.
                    <br><br>
                    Each COI represents one underlying Share. The main difference between holding CDls and Shares is that CDI holders
                    hold the beneficial ownership in the Shares instead of the legal title. CDN, a subsidiary of the Australian Stock
                    Exchange Limited (ASX), will hold the legal title to the underlying Shares. The Shares underlying the CDls will be
                    registered in the name of CDN and will be held on behalf of and for the benefit of the CDI Holder. CDls will be CHESS
                    approved from the date of official quotation in accordance with the Listing Rules and the ASX Settlement Operating
                    Rules. The Shares underlying the CDls will rank equally with the Shares currently on issue in the Company. A summary
                    of the key rights attaching to COis and shares is set out under the headings "Rights and Obligations Attaching to
                    Shares" and "Rights of CDI Holders” in Part IV, sections 1 and 2.
                    <br><br>
                    COI Holders can choose to have their CDls converted to a direct holding of Shares, however, if they do so they will
                    no longer be able to trade on NSX. Similarly, subject to any restrictions under applicable law, holders of Shares
                    may choose to convert their Shares to CDls to enable them to trade on NSX.

                    experts in their respective fields, to establish a unique company that creates value and dividend returns
                    through property investment delivered within the fast growing leisure market.
                    <br><br>
                    HIP Plc’s family-backed management brings experience, specialist market knowledge and relationships with
                    high-quality development partners acting as the property company to the David Lloyd Adventure Parks operating
                    company. HIP Plc has an exclusive long-term contractual relationship with DLAP, which will deliver a pipeline
                    of an initial twelve planned adventure parks venues over the next five years, with aspirations for a total of
                    eighty centres throughout the UK with the possibility of further growth into Europe. Mr David Lloyd, on behalf
                    of the David Lloyd Adventure Parks operating company is already searching for sites in 35 targeted UK cities
                    in an effort to open the next centres by January 2018.
                    <br><br>
                    The key highlights of the Company include:

                    the most number of members (DL Website) and the highest profit per club (David Lloyd annual accounts, 2012).
                    <br><br>
                    The first Adventure Park (called MegaJump), already open in North London will exceed a profit before tax of £600,000
                    in its opening year, a significantly higher than average return compared to the main leisure operators in the UK.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, there is a shareholder link with David Lloyd confirmed as non-executive Chairman of Holmes Investment

                    Adventure Parks operating company to complete the strength of relationship.
                    <br><br>

                    the next four years. The aspiration is for up to eighty adventure parks across the UK, with the possibility of
                    expanding into mainland Europe too. Holmes Investment Properties will own each site and will have a minimum 50-year
                    lease with the MegaJump Company with a guaranteed 8% yield with upwards only rent reviews (Appendix 4: contract).

                <h2>Part 1: Information on the Company</h2>
                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Holmes Investment Properties Plc was recently incorporated on 22nd July 2016 in England and Wales as a public
                    limited company with registration number 10292157. Its Registered Office is at 106 Mount Street, London W1K 2TW.
                </p>                
                <h3>2. Principal Activities</h3>
                <p>
                    Holmes Investment Properties has been established exclusively to fund and build new leisure centres for the
                    operating company known as David Lloyd Adventure Parks (DLAP).
                    <br><br>The current plan is for DLAP to open twelve venues by 2021 for which HIP Plc will finance the purchase
                    of the land plus develop the infrastructure and shell of the property.  The operating company, DLAP will be
                    responsible for the discovery of sites, planning permission, fit out, management and marketing of each centre.
                    <br><br>
                    The Company will be an exclusive partner with the David Lloyd Adventure Parks operating company, in which HIP
                    Plc will have a 15% shareholding. A full contractual relationship between the Company and DLAP has been concluded.
                    The DLAP relationship ensures that HIP Plc has a ready-made demand for its services.
                    <br><br>
                    Holmes Investment Properties will raise the finance for each adventure park through equity and borrowings.
                    HIP Plc has confirmed borrowings of £42M to date. (Appendix 5). This will allow borrowing covering 60% of the
                    price of land acquisition and for 100% of the development of the land.
                    <br><br>
                    HIP Plc will then charge an 8% rent on a minimum 50-year contract with DLAP with upward only rent reviews.
                    HIP Plc will be full owners of the land.
                    <br><br>
                    The Directors are of the opinion that the funds raised are sufficient for the Company to carry out its business plan,
                    to identify and carry out due diligence on potential acquisitions and investment targets and to provide working
                    capital for the Company’s initial operations in line with its strategy.
                </p>
                <h3>3. The Market</h3>
                <p>
                    The UK leisure market was worth £4.08 billion in 2014 (source: Savills), up 3.9% on 2013, with at least 6,112
                    leisure facilities in the UK and continues to grow by more 150 venues annually.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2016, the UK is in the seventh year of economic growth (Bank of England report) and consumers are spending
                    more of their disposable income on leisure-based activities. This has led to a resurgence from leisure activities
                    as a plethora of diverse new entrants are seeking space in the UK; offering activities such as adventure golf,
                    laser combat and high-wire, zip wires and trampolining.
                    <br><br>
                    In DLAP’s primary leisure offering, trampolining, The International Association of Trampoline Parks (IATP) estimates
                    that by the end of this year there will be more than 550 indoor trampoline parks open worldwide. Compare this to
                    more than 100,000 leisure centres around the globe and the opportunity is huge and will grow fast in the western
                    world over the next 5 years. A tipping point has been reached and the market is ripe for exploitation.
                    <br><br>
                    A number of overseas trampolining operators have begun to establish themselves although none yet have more than 5
                    centres. This includes Gravity, Gravity Zone, Gravity Force and Skyzone, who are all on the search for new sites.
                    There are at least 43 trampoline focussed clubs, with as many as 19 additional centres planned. The market is small,
                    but growing fast, with the number of venues forecast to grow by 50% in the next year or so, therefore the
                    opportunity is very much of the moment.

                            the parks are an ideal way for landlords to fill space that doesn’t appeal to retailers and we are now looking
                            for additional units between 6,000 sq ft and 16,000 sq ft in high footfall areas such as shopping centres,
                            high streets and retail or leisure parks.”

                    <br><br><br>
                    Once the twelve centres are open with revenue flowing in, the plan is to accelerate the strategy with a longer term
                    aim to build up to eighty adventure parks in the UK, and then beyond into Europe, with a further opportunity for a
                    franchising model further afield.
                    <br><br>
                    Holmes Investment Properties have secured funding to purchase the first twelve sites and build venues for new sites.
                    This will cover 60% of the cost of land purchase and 100% of the building costs.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <h4>3.1. The Adventure Parks Proposition</h4>
                <p>
                    Central to all adventure parks will be trampolining. The first adventure park, MegaJump is the ultimate family
                    trampoline destination with sessions and activities to suit everyone. The Company’s premier site was launched in
                    January 2016 located in London. It has a 12,000 Sq ft. jump zone where customers bounce their way through 117
                    interconnected trampolines. With the significant financial and end-user satisfaction with the first site,
                    the Company is now looking to expand the business.
                    <br><br>
                    The management team believe that David Lloyd Adventure Parks provide the safest trampoline equipment possible and
                    features only UK designed and manufactured equipment.  Trampoline parks have proved to be a very successful business
                    in the US, which had about forty such attractions in 2011. Management understands that number has increased
                    significantly to an estimated three hundred either in operation or under construction. The management team believe
                    that there is generally an increased emphasis on lifestyle-based activities and the desire to take part in something
                    different, the market for active leisure and lifestyle-oriented entertainment is one of the fastest growing sectors
                    of the leisure industry.
                    <br><br>
                    The Directors believe that a strategy focused on acquiring sites allowing purpose built venues will build competitive
                    advantage and build sustainable value. The creation of larger venues with a total operating area of up to
                    60,000 Sq. ft. will allow the provision of complementary facilities such as rope courses, dodge ball, climbing
                    “cardio” walls, crazy golf, zip line and outdoor facilities for the summer.
                    <br><br>
                    The David Lloyd Adventure Parks model is scalable across the whole of the UK and Europe. The rate of expansion of
                    adventure parks in Europe is slower than the UK, creating a potentially significant opportunity for the Company.
                    This is a post-revenue Company with demonstrable proof of concept with significant growth prospects and led by a
                    highly experienced and competent management team.
                </p>
                <h4>3.2. Investment strategy</h4>
                <h5>3.2.1. Use of proceeds</h5>
                <p>
                    The proceeds from the equity raised by listing will fund and build the first twelve venues. HIP’s total cost of acquisition and build per property is a planned £3.1M. The site acquisition cost will average £600k and the build costs per site will be approximately £2.5M. HIP Plc has secured borrowing for the first twelve sites as follows: For 60% of the purchase cost and 100% of the build cost.  Therefore, for each site, HIP Plc will use just £240k of the equity per site to acquire the land in addition to building out the site. Therefore, to develop twelve sites for opening and ready to pay 8% rent – typically £480k per annum per site - HIP Plc will use just £2.88M of the equity raised. In the first year, post-listing, equity will be used for overheads amounting to £50k to year-end 30th April 2017 and then £354k as working capital until revenue covers costs from December 2017 and repays costs by May 2018.
                    <br><br>
                    The Adventure Park operating company will find land and agree a purchase price with the owner (and HIP). Pre-purchase, the operating company will gain planning permission. Post-planning permission, Holmes Investment Properties will then use the proceeds of the equity, with confirmed borrowings, to acquire the sites. The planning permission will increase the value of the site to £2M. Based on an investment of £3.1m per site, HIP will revalue each site at £6.2m within 18 months. The site will be leased back to DLAP on an 8% yield with a 50-year minimum contract. On listing, the HIP Plc would be given an allocation of 15% in the Ordinary Shares of the operating company, adding further to the financial returns and valuation of HIP Plc.
                    <br><br>
                    Based on the preliminary illustrative financial model, HIP’s investment could generate a cumulative £45m in profit before tax after 5 years.
                    <br><br>
                    The operating company will target areas where there are sites suitable for leisure venue:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="target_requirements">Where more than 1 million people can get to the site within 45 minutes by car or public transport.</li>
                        <li class="target_requirements">Brownfield sites preferred.</li>
                        <li class="target_requirements">For purchase with likelihood of planning permission including car parking.</li>
                        <li class="target_requirements">Sites suitable for an adventure park, which is accessible and easy to see from road network.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>3.3. Competition</h4>
                <p>
                    The known property companies that are supporting leisure companies in the UK is M&G investments, which has a sale and lease back deal with Bannatyne’s Leisure Centres.  The 39 sites purchased by M&G Investments for £92M. There are 19 operators of Trampoline parks in the UK, with 43 known current venues, whilst KPMG claim there maybe up to 90 current centres.
                </p>
                <h3>4. Business Strategy</h3>
                <h4>4.1. Immediate Plan - first 2 years</h4>
                <p>
                    Source, purchase & fit out six adventure parks from the 35 cities chosen by the David Lloyd Adventure Parks operating company in conjunction with HIP Plc.
                </p>
                <h4>4.2. Medium-term plan – years 3 and ahead</h4>
                <p>
                    Roll out the adventure park concept to six more sites by end of 2019, in time for the Tokyo Olympics excitement in Summer 2020.
                </p>
                <h3>5. Management Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    The Directors will manage the business and have overall responsibility for the Company’s activities including its property investment activities and reviewing the performance of the Company.
                    <br><br>
                    The Company will not employ a large number of professional staff, as the Directors believe that it will be cost effective for these services to be contracted.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to the above, the Company has at its disposal the services of Robert Holmes & Co Limited, who have built a strong reputation for selling and acquiring buildings and sites for development, refurbishment and investment in southwest London.

                <h3>6. Board of Directors</h3>
                <h4>David Lloyd</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Age 71, Independent Non-Executive Chairman</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Mr Lloyd was born on 3rd January 1948 in the Great Britain. Mr. Lloyd and his younger brother,
                    John Lloyd were two of the most successful British tennis players throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
                    <br><br>
                    Following retirement from professional tennis, Mr. Lloyd worked for a number of years as a coach
                    at a tennis club in Canada. Here he got the idea of creating his own tennis and health club in the
                    UK and on his return to Britain, he founded the David Lloyd Leisure Clubs, opening the first club
                    in Heston, near Hounslow in west London, in 1982. It was a pioneering concept in health and fitness:
                    family oriented clubs with an emphasis on tennis. The business was floated on the London Stock
                    Exchange in 1992 and by 1995, there were 18 David Lloyd Leisure clubs, when Whitbread Plc acquired
                    the company for a reported £200 million, a record in the City at that time, incorporating it into
                    its Restaurants & Leisure Division. Lloyd remained as managing director of the division until 1996.
                    <br><br>
                    Mr. Lloyd, together with his son Scott, went on to create Next Generation fitness clubs and in 2007,
                    London & Regional Properties in partnership with Bank of Scotland, acquired David Lloyd Leisure from
                    Whitbread and incorporated Next Generation into the group for £925M.
                    <br><br>
                    Mr Lloyd has specific experience in finding sites and in particular developing eighteen significant
                    leisure centres, some of the biggest leisure venues in the country. Mr Lloyd found sites, gained
                    planning permission and funding, and built each of his first eighteen David Lloyd Centres from scratch.
                    Mr Lloyd has thirty years’ experience in successful, large leisure-orientated building projects in
                    the UK and across the world, creating highly valuable top-quality venues.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2013 the David Lloyd group was purchased by TDR Capital for £750M and now includes 91 UK and European
                    David Lloyd Leisure Clubs including two exclusive Harbour Clubs and five David Lloyd Studios, with a
                    membership of around 440,000 and employing some 6,000 staff. (Company website). The average David Lloyd
                    leisure centre was valued at £8.2M, far higher than any competitor sites, which are valued on average
                    between £3-4M. (Source: Virgin Active Annual Accounts 2015/Bannatyne’s public statement 2015).
                    <br><br>
                    David Lloyd is arguably the most successful leisure operator in the UK.  David Lloyd Clubs are valued at
                    £8.2M per club (when purchased by TDR Capital) and had a higher profit than competitors (last public
                    figures available 2012). David Lloyd clubs also have more members per club, higher revenue per club and
                    it is believed higher profitability per club than all of its competitors.
                    <br><br>
                    Following the sale of the leisure business, Mr. Lloyd turned his attention to real estate and developed
                    the highly acclaimed Sugar Hill Resort in Barbados, where purchasers included superstars, Sir Cliff
                    Richard, John Lodge of the Moody Blues and famous entertainers.
                    <br><br>
                    He  later  founded  David Lloyd  Resorts, a holiday property shared-ownership concept. More recently,
                    David Lloyd Signature Homes, was established, a property sales business specializing in French Alpine ski
                    properties and also featuring high quality properties in St Tropez, Monaco, a wine estate near Cap d'Agde
                    in the Languedoc region, city centre apartments in Lisbon Portugal and a beach-front resort in Mauritius.

                <p>
                    The Directors recognise the importance of corporate governance and intend, in so far as is practicable given the Company’s size and the constitution of the Board, to comply with the main provisions of the QCA Corporate Governance Code for Small and mid-sized Companies 2013. An Audit Committee will be established comprising of the Chairman and Bernard Sumner as the senior non exec Director.  No Remuneration Committee will be established; remuneration will be decided by the whole board. The Directors will ensure that the Company maintain policies and procedures, and have the requisite skills available and arrangements in place, to ensure that the requirements of the listing status on NSX Market are met for all accounting matters associated  with the Company.

                <p>
                    The Directors are of the opinion that, having made due and careful consideration, consider the Company to have sufficient working capital for its requirements that is for at least the next 12 months from the date of Admission.

                <h3>11. Dividend Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    The Company is primarily seeking to achieve capital growth for its Shareholders and it is the Board’s intention during the current phase of the Company’s development to retain future distributable profits and only recommend dividends when appropriate and practicable. The Directors do not intend to declare a dividend until the Company has achieved sufficient profitability and that it is commercially prudent to do so having regard to the resources needed for the Company’s growth.

                <p>
                    The Company has adopted and will operate a share dealing code to prevent the Directors and any applicable employees from dealing in Ordinary Shares during close periods in accordance with the NSX Market Rules.
                    <br><br>
                    [is this applicable in NSX, I would assume so as most markets require a close period.]

                <h3>15. The Withdrawal of the UK from the European Union (“Brexit”)</h3>
                <p>
                    On Friday 24th June, the UK electorate decided to leave the European Union. Since the referendum was announced in February, estate agents across the country have reported some amount of uncertainty in the market.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Uncertainty not materialised</strong>
                    The Treasury doomsday pre-referendum prediction that house prices will fall by up to 18% has not materialised. <strong>“Real estate markets always prefer certainty,”</strong> says Stephen Solomons from law firm Blake Morgan. <strong>“The last few months have led to a slowdown in transactions.  Now we know the result we expect to see the real estate markets pick up rapidly.”</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>House prices</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    The UK Property Transactions Statistics state that property sales continue to climb (Source: HMRC, 21st September 2016). House prices YOY continue to climb. The biggest long term survey going back 64 years states that house prices are up 5.2% in August 2016 and up 0.6% versus July 2016.
                    <br><br>
                    The August 2016 RICS Residential Market Survey results says confidence continues to recover gradually across the sector.  Prices and sales volumes are now expected to rise going forward, both at the three and twelve month time horizons, with a more stable trend in activity driving the improvement in sentiment. The headline price indicator edged higher during August, with a net balance of +12% of respondents reporting an increase in prices. (RICS, August Residential Market Survey).
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Interest rates</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    The Bank of England has cut interest rates to a record low of just 0.25%.  Lower interest rates always support asset prices and this has fuelled the dramatic growth in prices over the last 8 years. These low rates are expected to continue for the indefinite future.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Only a short-term impact</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    The EU relationship is a political problem that will find a political solution – it is not about the economics. There is likely to be a wobble as the future for the UK’s relationship with Europe remains unclear, but prices and market activity are expected to settle quickly.
                    <br><br>
                    Most commentators are in agreement that the UK will continue to be a global powerhouse in the long-term, and will therefore continue to attract investment, including in the property market.

                    <h2>Part 2: Risk Factors</h2>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the usual risks associated with an investment in a business at an early stage of its development, the Directors have identified the risks described below, which could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company. It should be noted that the risks described below are not the only risks faced by the Company; there may be additional risks that the Directors currently consider not to be material or of which they are unaware.
                        <br><br>
                        A prospective investor should consider carefully whether an investment in the Company is suitable for him/her in the light of his/her personal circumstances and the financial resources available to him/her. If you are in any doubt as to the action you should take, you should consult a person authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 who specialises in advising on the acquisition of shares and other securities (<strong>Not sure of the wording for this on NSX</strong>)
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Factors that may affect the Company’s ability to fulfil its obligations under the Ordinary Shares</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>The Company is newly formed and has a limited operating history</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Despite the Directors’ extensive experience, the Company was newly formed on 22nd July 2016 and has no trading and no operating history from which to assess its future expected performance and success.  Accordingly, the Company has no historical financial statements and meaningful operating or financial data with which to evaluate the Company and its performance.  Consequently, the Company’s intended business and operations may not prove to be successful in the near future, if at all. Any future success will depend upon many factors, several of which may be beyond the Company’s control, or which cannot be predicted at this time.  Whilst the Directors are confident about the Company’s prospects, there is no certainty that anticipated revenues or growth can be achieved.  If the Company is not successful in achieving its commercial objectives, the Company’s business and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Risks related to investments in small business</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>1. Investment in small companies carries greater risks than investment in larger companies.</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        There can be no assurance as to how long it will take for the Company to invest all of the sums to be raised hereby and the longer the period the greater the likelihood that the Company’s results of operations will be materially adversely affected. Many factors outside the control of the Directors could influence the performance of the Company and Investors may therefore realise less than the original amount invested or lose their investment entirely.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>2. Risks relating to the Company Investment range and performance</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        The Company will be dependent upon the Directors successful implementation of the Company’s investment strategy, and ultimately on its ability to create a property portfolio capable of generating attractive returns. This implementation in turn will be subject to a number factors, including market conditions and the timing of investments relative to market conditions which are inherent in the property development industry, many of which are beyond the control of the Company and difficult to predict. A key factor influencing the Company’s investment returns will be the performance of the UK property market.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>3. Dependence on availability of capital</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Whilst it is not anticipated that the Company will borrow to make finance acquisition and development costs, the Company may do so. Should the Company require further additional funds, these may not be available.
                        <br><br>
                        Borrowing exposes the Company to movements in loan interest rates and the possibility that if the values of properties fall, the Company’s capital repayment commitments may exceed the capital value of the Company’s assets.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>4. The Company may not identify all risks and liabilities in respect of an investment</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        The Company has no prior operating history and none of Company’s investments have been acquired. Whilst the Directors and, in particular, their appointed advisers, have a large amount of experience in the property acquisition and development industry there can be no guarantee that the Directors possess all of the skills necessary in order to carry out the investment strategies of the Company. The activity of identifying, completing and realising on attractive real estate related investments involves a high degree of uncertainty, this may impact on the profitability of the investment.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>5. Competition</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Competition may exist that has not been mentioned in this Document or that the Company may not be aware of and which may adversely affect the Company’s business. The property development industry is a competitive industry and there may be developments that the Company is not aware of that may compete with the Company’s offerings and products.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>6. Risk to changes in regulation</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        The Company will be under a duty to comply with any new rules, regulations and laws applicable to ownership of real estate property, including changes to planning laws and environmental factors. Approvals, licences and permits are, as a practical matter, subject to the discretion of the applicable governments or governmental offices. The Company must comply with existing standards, laws and regulations that may entail greater or lesser costs and delays, depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted and the permitting authority. New laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. The Company's intended activities will be dependent upon the grant and maintenance of appropriate licences, leases, permits and regulatory consents which could subsequently be withdrawn or made subject to limitations. There can be no assurance that they will be granted, renewed or, if so, on what terms.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>7. Operational Risk</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Operational risk and losses can result from external and internal failures or inadequacies, failure to comply with regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules, natural disasters or the failure of external systems, for example, those of the Company's contractual counterparties.
                        <br><br>
                        Terrorist acts, other acts of war or hostility and geopolitical, pandemic or other such events may result in economic and political uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on the United Kingdom and international economic conditions and more specifically on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or prospects. Notwithstanding anything in this risk factor, this risk factor should not be taken as implying that the Company will be unable to comply with its obligations as a company with securities admitted to the NSX Market.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>8. Dependence on key personnel</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        The Company's future performance and success is substantially dependent on the continued services and continuing contributions of its Directors and senior management. Although the Company has agreed contractual arrangements to secure the services of the Directors, the retention of these services cannot be guaranteed. The loss of the services of any of the Company's executive officers or senior management could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.
                        <br><br>
                        The Company's future success will also depend on its ability to attract and retain additional suitably qualified and experienced employees. There can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to attract and retain such employees, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results or operations of the Company.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>9. Taxation</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        This document has been prepared in accordance with current UK tax legislation, practice and concession and interpretation thereof. Any change in the Company’s tax status or in taxation legislation could affect the Company’s ability to provide returns to Ordinary Shareholders or alter post tax returns to Ordinary Shareholders. Statements in this document concerning the taxation of Ordinary Shareholders are based on current tax law and practice which is subject to change. The taxation of an investment in the Company depends on the individual circumstances of investors.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>10. Changes in interest rates</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the results of the Company’s operations by increasing finance costs. Any increase in interest rates would increase debt service costs and would adversely  affect the Company’s cash flow. Changes in interest rates could therefore have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. In addition, if interest rates on any future borrowing entered into are higher than the rates applicable to existing debt, then the Company’s profitability may be  affected.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>11. Risk of damage to reputation and negative publicity</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        The Company’s ability to retain existing management contracts and client relationships and to attract    new business is dependent on the maintenance of its reputation. The Company is vulnerable to adverse market perception as it operates in an industry where a high level of integrity and client trust is paramount. Any perceived, actual or alleged mismanagement, fraud or failure to satisfy the Company’s responsibilities, or the negative publicity resulting from such activities or the allegation by a third party of such activities (whether  well founded or not) associated with the Company, could  have a  material adverse effect on   the  financial  condition, results or operations of the Company.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>12. Litigation</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Legal proceedings may arise from time to time in the course of the Company’s businesses. The Directors cannot  preclude that litigation may be brought against the Company and that such litigation could have  a material  adverse effect on the financial condition, results or operations of the Company.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Risks related to the market generally</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>13. NSX Market</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        The Ordinary shares will be traded on the NSX Market. Admission to the NSX Market should not be taken to imply that there is or will be a liquid market in the Ordinary Shares. NSX Market is a market designed for small and growing companies. Both types of company carry higher than normal financial risk and tend to experience lower levels of liquidity than larger companies. Any changes to the regulatory environment, in particular the Rules could, for example, affect the ability of the Company to maintain a trading facility for the Ordinary shares on the NSX Market.
                        <br><br>                      
                        <strong>The secondary market generally</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        1. The Ordinary Shares may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a market does develop, it may not be very liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Ordinary Shares easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market. The Ordinary Shares are designed for specific investment objectives or strategies. As such, the Ordinary Shares generally will have a more limited secondary market and more price volatility than conventional debt securities. Illiquidity may have a severely adverse effect on the market value of the Ordinary Shares.
                        <br><br>
                        2. [Not sure if there are market Makers on NSX] will be appointed as registered market-maker in respect of the Ordinary Shares from the date of admission of the Ordinary Shares to trading. Market-making means that a person will quote prices for buying and selling the Ordinary Shares during trading hours. However, the appointed market maker may not continue to act for the life of the Ordinary Shares. In such circumstances the Board will seek to appoint a replacement market-maker as soon as possible but any delay in such appointment could have an adverse impact on your ability to sell the Ordinary Shares.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>3. Realisation from sale of the Ordinary Shares may be less than original investments</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Ordinary Shareholders who choose to have their Ordinary Shares at any time prior to their maturity, may receive a price from such sale which is less than the original investment made. Factors that will influence the price may include, but are not limited to, market appetite, inflation, and the time of redemption, interest rates and the current financial position and an assessment of the future prospects of the Company.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>4. Exchange rate risks and exchange controls</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        The Company will pay principal and interest on the Ordinary Shares in Sterling. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit other than Sterling. These include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of Sterling or revaluation of the investor's currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the investor's currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the investor's currency relative to Sterling would decrease (i) the investor's currency-equivalent yield on the Ordinary Shares, (ii) the investor's currency-equivalent value of the principal payable on the Ordinary Shares and (iii) the investor's currency-equivalent market value of the Ordinary Shares. Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>5. The Withdrawal of the UK from the European Union (“Brexit”)</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        The Board note the material uncertainty as to the possible economic consequences of a withdrawal by the United Kingdom from the European Union.  In particular, the Board notes speculation that may reduce both land values and property sales. However, 3 months after the referendum there is no sign of any slow-down. Reference is made to Part II, section 20 for the Board’s expanded view on this matter. The Board are confident that demand for property will not diminish.

                        The company will develop twelve sites over a 4-year period and monitor progress during the development phase.
                        During this phase Return on Capital Employed varies between 25 and 62.3% pa, assuming a 60% gearing.

                        <br><br>
                        With the exception of voting rights CDI Holders have the equivalent rights as holders of ordinary Shares whereby the security is registered in their own name. This means that all economic benefits such as dividends, bonus issues, rights issues or similar corporate actions flow through to the CDI Holder as if the CDI Holder were the legal owner.
                        <br><br>
                        The ASX Settlement Operating Rules require the Company to give notices to CDI Holders of general meetings of shareholders. The notice of meeting must include a form permitting the CDI Holder to direct CDN to cast proxy votes in accordance with the CDI Holder's written directions. COi  Holders cannot vote directly at Shareholder meetings.
The COI Holder must convert their COis into certificated shares prior to the relevant meeting in order to vote at the meeting in person.

                        <strong>11.1. Converting from a CDI to a Share</strong>

                        COI Holders may at any time convert their holding of COis (tradeable on NSX) to certificated Shares:
                        <br><br>
                        1. For CO is held through the issuer sponsored sub-register, contacting Board Room in Australia directly to obtain the applicable request form. The removed holding would then be registered into the same address that appeared on the Australian COi register; or
                        <br><br>
                        2. For COis held on the CHESS sub-register, contacting their controlling participant (generally a stockbroker), who will liaise with BoardRoom in Australia to obtain and complete the request form. Upon receipt of a request form, the relevant number of COis will be cancelled and Shares will be transferred from CON into the name of the COi Holder and a registered share certificate be issued. This will cause your Shares to be registered on the certificated Samoan Register of Members and trading will no longer be possible on NSX.
                        <br><br>
                        A holder of Shares may also convert their Shares to COis, subject to any escrow arrangements, by contacting BoardRoom or their stockbroker (or applicable controlling participant). In this case, the Shares registered in the Shareholder's name will be transferred to CON and a holding statement in respect of the COis will be issued to the COi Holder. The COis will be tradeable on NSX.
