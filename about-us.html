                <h3>Non-Executive Chairman</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Mr Lloyd was born on 3rd January 1948 in Great
                        Britain. Along with his younger brother, John, they
                        were two of the most successful British tennis
                        players of their generation.
                    </strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Following retirement from professional tennis, Mr Lloyd worked
                    as a coach at a tennis club in Canada, where he got the idea
                    of creating his own tennis and health clubs in the UK. On his
                    return to Britain, he founded David Lloyd Leisure Clubs with the
                    first venue opening in west London at Heston in 1982.
                    <br><br>
                    It was a pioneering concept in health and fitness:
                    family-orientated clubs with an emphasis on tennis. The
                    business was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1992
                    and by 1995, there were 18 David Lloyd Leisure Clubs, when
                    Whitbread Ltd acquired the company for a reported £200
                    million, a record in the City at that time, incorporating it into its
                    Restaurants & Leisure Division. Mr Lloyd remained as
                    managing director of the division until 1996.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Mr Lloyd, together with his son, Scott, went on to create Next Generation fitness clubs. This new
                    company was then purchased in 2007 by the then owners of David Lloyd Leisure valuing both
                    companies at a joint price of £925 million.
                    <br><br>
                    Mr Lloyd has specific experience in finding sites and has developed some of the biggest in the UK. Since
                    1982, he found sites, gained planning permission, received funding and built each of his first eighteen
                    David Lloyd Leisure Centres from scratch. Mr Lloyd has thirty years’ experience in successful, large
                    leisure-orientated building projects in the UK and across the world, creating highly valuable top-quality
                    venues.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2013 the David Lloyd group was purchased by TDR Capital for over £700 million and now includes 91 UK and
                    European David Lloyd Leisure Clubs including two exclusive Harbour Clubs and five David Lloyd Studios,
                    with a membership of around 440,000 and employing some 6,000 staff. (Company website). The
                    average David Lloyd leisure centre was valued at £7.97M, far higher than any competitor sites, which are
                    valued on average between £3-4M. (Source: Virgin Active Annual Accounts 2015/Bannatyne’s public
                    statement 2015).
                    <br><br>
                    Following the sale of his leisure businesses, Mr. Lloyd turned his attention to real estate and developed
                    the highly acclaimed Sugar Hill Resort in Barbados, where purchasers included superstars, Sir Cliff
                    Richard, John Lodge of the Moody Blues and famous entertainers.
                    He later founded David Lloyd Resorts, a holiday property shared-ownership concept. More recently, Mr
                    Lloyd established David Lloyd Signature Homes, a property sales business specialising in French Alpine
                    ski properties as well as featuring high quality properties in St Tropez, Monaco, a wine estate in the
                    Languedoc region, city centre apartments in Lisbon, Portugal and a beach-front resort in Mauritius.

                When I retired from professional tennis many years ago, I saw an opening in
                the leisure market. I felt I could give the same opportunity that I had to
                millions of people. Until then many perceived that high quality tennis and
                leisure clubs were the preserve of a few. I believed I could open the market
                to a much broader population. So, I found locations and started to build
                David Lloyd sports and racket clubs in towns and cities across the UK. The
                company that still bears my name today was purchased for £925 million in 2007
                and again for over £700 million in 2013 and has been followed by many
                competitors. By 2015, 9.2 million people were members of leisure clubs in
                the UK, that’s 14.3% of the population, a statistic I am very proud of.
                <br><br>
                The leisure market continues to diversify and new opportunities have come
                along in different sports. I am now committed to making these available to a
                broader population too. My new idea could therefore, be an even more
                popular proposition than my successful forays in sports and leisure in the
                past.
                <br><br>
                My plan is to put fun, energetic, rare-to-find activities, which are great fun for
                everyone, together such as zip-wire adventures, climbing “cardio” walls, soft
                play areas for the under 5s, internal crazy golf courses and an incredible
                trampoline offer, where over 100 trampolines are connected for guests to
                bounce and somersault around the whole venue.
                The benefits of these simple-to-learn sports are they can be enjoyed by
                individuals and families and at all ages. The other good news is that these
                activities can be delivered in small spaces, which can be found in
                easy-to-get-to locations.
                <br><br>
                In leisure centres today, food is almost an after-thought, with regimented
                bland pizza and chips on offer, not for enjoyment but for fast consumption
                which is quickly forgotten! Themed restaurants have proven that food can be
                interesting, healthy and entertaining. Fun, fresh, quality food can be offered
                anywhere with proper application, and that’s exactly what I aim to do in our
                new sports and leisure venues.
                <br><br>
                My new business proposition offers two bites of the monetary cherry:
                Delivering hard-to-find sporty activities and fun, fresh food situated on
                relatively low cost, small scale sites in convenient locations that will appeal
                to all ages, all individuals and all families. Add in my brand name; known
                and trusted in this arena for more than 30 years, and I believe we will have a
                fast growing business very quickly. In fact, I am already involved in a test
                venue open, under a different brand name, in the suburbs of London. It was
                cash positive from day one of launch, a gross profit was achieved in month
                one and my aim is that all investment will be paid back by the end of year
                one. When I add my name to the concept, I hope it will grow its popularity
                further.
                <br><br>
                As our first operational test venue has made a net profit before tax, I want to
                offer the concept, adding my brand name, to the whole country, and in the
                future, across Europe too. I need to act fast to ensure market leadership for
                our new venture, to be called David Lloyd’s Adventure Parks.
                <br><br>
                The success of the venture is as dependent on
                property skills as much as it is leisure operating skills. The property element
                is the catalyst for the operation. That’s why I have teamed up with a group
                of senior property professionals to form Holmes Investment Properties Ltd
                (HIP Ltd). HIP Ltd will be led by the Holmes family. Like me, they have run
                eponymous businesses for many decades. Mr Holmes senior started his
                surveying company back in the 1950s. Then Robert Holmes, his son, began
                his highly successful property investment company in Wimbledon Village in
                1987. Robert’s sons, James and Nick Holmes, are involved in their father’s
                agency, their own property dealings, and now HIP Ltd.
                <br><br>
                Holmes Investment Properties will fund sites and the development then charge
                a pre-agreed, long-term contractual rent on each site to the operating
                company, David Lloyd’s Adventure Parks Ltd. Each site will have a long-term
                contract between HIP and David Lloyd’s Adventure Parks Ltd
                operating company. We have faith in the sixty years of property experience
                that the Holmes family have delivered.
                <br><br>
                With a ready-made market, HIP Ltd will have a head start working with a
                post-revenue company with another well-known, successful family brand
                name. I will continue as Executive Chairman of David Lloyd’s Adventure
                Parks Ltd and be connected with HIP as non-executive Chairman for the
                property company, as well as 15% shareholder in HIP Ltd. I hope you can
                support our new adventure; I think it will be very exciting for all of us.
