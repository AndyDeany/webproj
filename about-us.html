                <h3>Non-Executive Chairman<br><span class="medium">UK Adventure Parks division</span></h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Mr Lloyd was born on 3rd January 1948 in Great Britain. Along with his younger brother, John, they were two of the most successful British tennis players of their generation.
                    </strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Following retirement from professional tennis, Mr Lloyd worked as a coach at a tennis club in Canada, where he got the idea of creating his own tennis and health clubs in the UK. On his return to Britain, he founded David Lloyd Leisure Clubs with the first venue opening in west London at Heston in 1982.
                    <br><br>
                    It was a pioneering concept in health and fitness; family-orientated clubs with an emphasis on tennis. The business was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1992 and by 1995, there were 18 David Lloyd Leisure Clubs, when Whitbread Plc acquired the company for a reported £200 million, a record in the City at that time, incorporating it into its Restaurants & Leisure Division. Mr Lloyd remained as managing director of the division before leaving the company in 1996.
                    <br><br>
                    Mr Lloyd, together with his son, Scott, went on to create Next Generation fitness clubs. This new company was then purchased in 2007 by the then owners of David Lloyd Leisure valuing both companies at a joint price of £925 million.
                    <br><br>
                    Mr Lloyd has specific experience in finding sites and has developed some of the biggest in the UK. Since 1982, he found sites, gained planning permission, received funding and built each of the first eighteen David Lloyd Leisure Centres from scratch. Mr Lloyd has thirty years’ experience in successful, large sports-orientated building projects in the UK and across the world, creating highly valuable top-quality venues.
                    <br><br>
                    Following the sale of his leisure businesses, Mr. Lloyd turned his attention to real estate and developed the highly acclaimed Sugar Hill Resort in Barbados, where purchasers included superstars, Sir Cliff Richard, John Lodge of the Moody Blues and famous entertainers.
                    <br><br>
                    He later founded David Lloyd Resorts, a holiday property shared-ownership concept. More recently, Mr Lloyd established David Lloyd Signature Homes, a property sales business specialising in French Alpine ski properties as well as featuring high quality properties in St Tropez, Monaco, a wine estate in the Languedoc region, city centre apartments in Lisbon, Portugal and a beach-front resort in Mauritius.

        <div class="white"><div style="width:60%;">
            <p class="medium">
                When I retired from professional tennis many years ago, I saw an opening in the sports and leisure market. I felt I could give the same opportunity that I had to millions of people. Until then, many perceived that high-quality tennis and leisure clubs were the preserve of a few. I believed I could open the market to a much broader population.  So, I found locations and started to build David Lloyd sports and racket clubs in towns and cities across the UK. Although I left the company in 1996, it still bears my name today, and was purchased most recently for £750 million in 2013. By 2015, 9.2 million people were members of leisure clubs in the UK, that’s 14.3% of the population; a statistic I am very proud of.
                <br><br>
                The market continues to diversify, creating new opportunities, which have come along in different sports that are far more active, participatory and are all about fun rather than leisure. I am now committed to making these recreational, fun sports available to a broader population too. My new idea could, therefore, be an even more popular proposition than my successful forays in the past. My plan is to put together a number of exciting, energetic, rare-to-find activities in one venue, which are great fun for everyone. These include zip-wire adventures, climbing “cardio” walls, soft play areas for the under 5s, internal crazy golf courses and an incredible trampoline offer, where over 100 trampolines are connected for guests to bounce and somersault around to their heart’s content.
                <br><br>
                The benefits of these simple-to-learn but hard-to-find sports are they can be enjoyed by individuals and families and at all ages.  The other good news is that these activities can be delivered in compact spaces, which can be found in easy-to-get-to locations.
                <br><br>
                In recreational centres today, food is almost an after-thought, with regimented bland pizza and chips on offer, not for enjoyment but for fast consumption which is quickly forgotten! Themed restaurants have proven that food can be interesting, healthy and entertaining. Fun, fresh, quality food can be offered anywhere with proper application, and that’s exactly what I aim to do in our new active, recreation venues.
                <br><br>
                My new business proposition aims to deliver two bites of the monetary cherry: Delivering hard-to-find sporty activities and fun, fresh food situated on relatively low cost, indoor and outdoor sites in convenient locations that should appeal to all ages, all individuals and all families. Add in my brand name; known and trusted in this arena for more than 30 years, and I believe we will have a fast-growing business very quickly. In fact, I am already involved in a test venue open, under a different brand name, in the suburbs of London.  It was cash positive from day one of launch and has been very profitable in its first year. When I add my name to the concept, I hope my new active sports venues company will grow fast.
                <br><br>
                As the test venue has made a net profit before tax in its first year, I now want to offer the concept to the whole country, and in the future, across Europe too. I need to act fast to ensure market leadership for our new venture.
                <br><br>
                In order to deliver the fastest possible roll-out of my adventure parks, I am partnering with Holmes Investment Properties, who will finance and own our sites as well as fund the building of the new centres. Land costs in UK towns and cities are now significantly higher in relative terms to when I started out in 1982. Therefore, the success of the venture is as dependent on property skills as much as it is recreational sports operating skills. The property element is the catalyst for the operation. That’s why I have teamed up with a group of senior property professionals to form Holmes Investment Properties (HIP). HIP will continue the Holmes family legacy having run eponymous property businesses for many decades. Mr Holmes senior started his surveying company back in the 1950s. Then Robert Holmes, his son, began his highly successful property investment company in Wimbledon Village in 1987. Robert’s sons, James and Nicolas Holmes, are involved in their father’s agency, their own property dealings, and now HIP.
                <br><br>
                My adventure parks company – the working title is (“Adventure Parks”), in which I am the biggest shareholder has contractually agreed that Holmes Investment Properties will have a 20-year exclusivity agreement to fund both the sites and the development of all our adventure park sites.  HIP Plc will own or have long-term leases on all sites. Furthermore, HIP Plc will charge a pre-agreed, long-term contractual rent of 8% per annum or more on each site to my company. There will be a 25-year minimum commercial contract between HIP Plc and my company for each site.
                <br><br>
                We have faith in the sixty years of property experience that the Holmes family have delivered. With a ready-made market, HIP Plc will have a head start working with another well-known, successful family brand name. I plan to continue to be the Executive Chairman of the operating company and be non-executive Chairman of the UK Adventure Parks division within HIP Plc, as well as 15% shareholder in HIP Plc. I hope you can support our new adventure; I think it will be very exciting for all of us.
