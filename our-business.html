                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Holmes Investment Properties Plc was recently incorporated on 22nd July 2016 in England and Wales as a public
                    limited company with registration number 10292157. Its Registered Office is at 106 Mount Street, London W1K 2TW.
                </p>
                
                <a name="2"></a>
                <h2>Principal Activities</h2>
                <p>
                    Holmes Investment Properties has been established exclusively to fund and build new leisure centres for the
                    operating company known as David Lloyd Adventure Parks (DLAP).
                    <br><br>The current plan is for DLAP to open twelve venues by 2021 for which HIP Plc will finance the purchase
                    of the land plus develop the infrastructure and shell of the property.  The operating company, DLAP will be
                    responsible for the discovery of sites, planning permission, fit out, management and marketing of each centre.
                    <br><br>
                    The Company will be an exclusive partner with the David Lloyd Adventure Parks operating company, in which HIP
                    Plc will have a 15% shareholding. A full contractual relationship between the Company and DLAP has been concluded.
                    The DLAP relationship ensures that HIP Plc has a ready-made demand for its services.
                    <br><br>
                    Holmes Investment Properties will raise the finance for each adventure park through equity and borrowings.
                    HIP Plc has confirmed borrowings of £42M to date. (Appendix 5). This will allow borrowing covering 60% of the
                    price of land acquisition and for 100% of the development of the land.
                    <br><br>
                    HIP Plc will then charge an 8% rent on a minimum 50-year contract with DLAP with upward only rent reviews.
                    HIP Plc will be full owners of the land.
                    <br><br>
                    The Directors are of the opinion that the funds raised are sufficient for the Company to carry out its business plan,
                    to identify and carry out due diligence on potential acquisitions and investment targets and to provide working
                    capital for the Company’s initial operations in line with its strategy.

                <h2>The Market</h2>
                <p>
                    The UK leisure market was worth £4.08 billion in 2014 (source: Savills), up 3.9% on 2013, with at least 6,112
                    leisure facilities in the UK and continues to grow by more 150 venues annually.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2016, the UK is in the seventh year of economic growth (Bank of England report) and consumers are spending
                    more of their disposable income on leisure-based activities. This has led to a resurgence from leisure activities
                    as a plethora of diverse new entrants are seeking space in the UK; offering activities such as adventure golf,
                    laser combat and high-wire, zip wires and trampolining.
                    <br><br>
                    In DLAP’s primary leisure offering, trampolining, The International Association of Trampoline Parks (IATP) estimates
                    that by the end of this year there will be more than 550 indoor trampoline parks open worldwide. Compare this to
                    more than 100,000 leisure centres around the globe and the opportunity is huge and will grow fast in the western
                    world over the next 5 years. A tipping point has been reached and the market is ripe for exploitation.
                    <br><br>
                    A number of overseas trampolining operators have begun to establish themselves although none yet have more than 5
                    centres. This includes Gravity, Gravity Zone, Gravity Force and Skyzone, who are all on the search for new sites.
                    There are at least 43 trampoline focussed clubs, with as many as 19 additional centres planned. The market is small,
                    but growing fast, with the number of venues forecast to grow by 50% in the next year or so, therefore the
                    opportunity is very much of the moment.

                            the parks are an ideal way for landlords to fill space that doesn’t appeal to retailers and we are now looking
                            for additional units between 6,000 sq ft and 16,000 sq ft in high footfall areas such as shopping centres,
                            high streets and retail or leisure parks.”

                    Transaction volumes in the core UK leisure markets of leisure parks, restaurants, health & fitness, bingo/bowl and
                    cinemas was £3.29B in 2014. Development has been driven by increased consumer spend.
                    <br><br>
                    Holmes Investment Properties Plc have agreed to finance the property investment in the business, by the acquisition
                    of suitable sites - subject to planning - and building the Park with an agreed sale and leaseback arrangement with
                    Megajump with a minimum 50-year contract. The plan is to raise the capital to develop the model in twelve sites
                    across the UK, from 35 potential cities as follows:

                    Once the twelve centres are open with revenue flowing in, the plan is to accelerate the strategy with a longer term
                    aim to build up to eighty adventure parks in the UK, and then beyond into Europe, with a further opportunity for a
                    franchising model further afield.
                    <br><br>
                    Holmes Investment Properties have secured funding to purchase the first twelve sites and build venues for new sites.
                    This will cover 60% of the cost of land purchase and 100% of the building costs.

                <h3>The Adventure Parks Proposition</h3>
                <p>
                    Central to all adventure parks will be trampolining. The first adventure park, MegaJump is the ultimate family
                    trampoline destination with sessions and activities to suit everyone. The Company’s premier site was launched in
                    January 2016 located in London. It has a 12,000 Sq ft. jump zone where customers bounce their way through 117
                    interconnected trampolines. With the significant financial and end-user satisfaction with the first site,
                    the Company is now looking to expand the business.
                    <br><br>
                    The management team believe that David Lloyd Adventure Parks provide the safest trampoline equipment possible and
                    features only UK designed and manufactured equipment.  Trampoline parks have proved to be a very successful business
                    in the US, which had about forty such attractions in 2011. Management understands that number has increased
                    significantly to an estimated three hundred either in operation or under construction. The management team believe
                    that there is generally an increased emphasis on lifestyle-based activities and the desire to take part in something
                    different, the market for active leisure and lifestyle-oriented entertainment is one of the fastest growing sectors
                    of the leisure industry.
                    <br><br>
                    The Directors believe that a strategy focused on acquiring sites allowing purpose built venues will build competitive
                    advantage and build sustainable value. The creation of larger venues with a total operating area of up to
                    60,000 Sq. ft. will allow the provision of complementary facilities such as rope courses, dodge ball, climbing
                    “cardio” walls, crazy golf, zip line and outdoor facilities for the summer.
                    <br><br>
                    The David Lloyd Adventure Parks model is scalable across the whole of the UK and Europe. The rate of expansion of
                    adventure parks in Europe is slower than the UK, creating a potentially significant opportunity for the Company.
                    This is a post-revenue Company with demonstrable proof of concept with significant growth prospects and led by a
                    highly experienced and competent management team.

                <a name="3.2"><h3>David Lloyd Adventure Parks Leisure Venues</h3></a>
                <p>
                    The company will develop twelve sites over a 4-year period and monitor progress during the development phase.
                    During this phase Return on Capital Employed varies between 25 and 62.3% pa, assuming a 60% gearing.
                    <br><br>
                    During the mature phase ROCE drops to 20.8%, and at this point, the company will decide either to continue to 
                    develop more sites in the UK and Europe, or it will return capital to shareholders.
