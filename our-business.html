                <p class="big">
                    In 2016, the UK is in the seventh year of economic
                    growth (Bank of England report) and consumers
                    are spending more of their disposable income on
                    leisure-based activities.
                    <br><br>
                    This has led to a resurgence from leisure activities
                    as a plethora of diverse new entrants are seeking
                    space in the UK; offering activities such as
                    adventure golf, laser combat and high-wire, zip
                    wires and trampolining.
                </p>
                <p class="medium">
                    Specifically, of one of the Adventure Parks leading offerings,
                    trampolining, which was the leading activity at the test
                    concept venue, The International Association of Trampoline
                    Parks (IATP) estimates that by the end of this year there will be
                    more than 550 indoor trampoline parks open worldwide.
                    Compare this to more than 100,000 leisure centres around the
                    globe and the opportunity is huge and will grow fast in the
                    western world over the next 5 years. A tipping point has been
                    reached and the market is ripe for exploitation.
                    <br><br>
                    A number of overseas trampolining-led operators have begun
                    to establish themselves although none yet have more than 5
                    centres. This includes Gravity, Gravity Zone, Gravity Force and
                    Skyzone, who are all on the search for new sites. There are at
                    least 43 trampoline-based clubs, with as many as 19 additional
                    centres planned. The market is small, but growing fast, with
                    the number of venues forecast to grow by 50% in the next year
                    or so, therefore the opportunity is very much of the moment.
                    <br><br>
                    Transaction volumes in the core UK leisure markets of leisure
                    parks, restaurants, health & fitness, bingo/bowl and cinemas
                    was £3.29 billion in 2014. Development has been driven by
                    increased consumer spend.
